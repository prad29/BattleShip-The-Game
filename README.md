# BattleShip-The-Game
This repository contains a small game that I built, much alike the famous battleship game, 
where you have to guess the position of a hidden battleship on a squareboard.


For the time being it's on a 5x5 squareboard and user gets 3 guesses to sink the battleship
by guessing the location of the battleship on the squareboard(ocean). 

The code is written in Python, and serves small project for me as well as others who have just learnt the basics of Python.
You can also add on to your Battleship! program to make it more complex and fun to play.

More ideas are listed below if you want to contribute to the project,

1. Make multiple battleships: you'll need to be careful because you need to make sure that you don’t place battleships on top of 
each other on the game board. You'll also want to make sure that you balance the size of the board with the number of ships so the 
game is still challenging and fun to play.

2. Make battleships of different sizes: this is trickier than it sounds. 
All the parts of the battleship need to be vertically or horizontally touching and you’ll need to make sure you don’t 
accidentally place part of a ship off the side of the board.

3. Make your game a two-player game.

4. Use functions to allow your game to have more features like rematches, statistics and more!
